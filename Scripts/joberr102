Multiprocess sampling (20 chains in 20 jobs)
NUTS: [gamma, scalar, sigma, t0, Beta, Amplitude, tfall, trise]
The acceptance probability does not match the target. It is 0.7175193911815212, but should be close to 0.8. Try to increase the number of tuning steps.
There were 7 divergences after tuning. Increase `target_accept` or reparameterize.
The acceptance probability does not match the target. It is 0.6967511260374468, but should be close to 0.8. Try to increase the number of tuning steps.
The number of effective samples is smaller than 25% for some parameters.
